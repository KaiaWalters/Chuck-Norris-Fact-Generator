Generates fun "facts" about actor Chuck Norris

## How its Made
The application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, express, and an external API.


## Reflections
In the future I would like to find a way to make the speech bubble wrap around the generated text better. Upon reflection I could have created a speech bubble using HTML and CSS rather than a png. Will definitely get back to this. I think it ould also be cool if I could filter out distasteful Chuck Norris facts. Maybe by searching for Keywords in the api response.
